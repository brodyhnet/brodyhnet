        nick the cat's tech tips was a dumb joke i made in january 2021. <br> the digital master of the tape is lost and all that exists now is a vhs tape master. here's some photos of the 2nd gen tape:

        <b>The original "master" (first generation tape) was transferred onto a 2nd generation tape <br>(tape with a recording of the master) to avoid me messing up and damaging the master tape, <br>which would've been bad. I also put some info before the video starts. <br>some notable differences are the old transfer is in the wrong framerate (30fps converted from 29.97NTSC) <br>but this one has some weird frame dropouts. On the start of the old video, <br>the PLAY thing is covering part of the screen. It's obviously not in this new one. <br>The old transfer has low bitrate, meaning lower digital quality (not a issue here), <br>but this new transfer is a generation higher than the old one, so that's lower analog quality. <br>There's more detail on this one though.
